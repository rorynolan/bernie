<div id="the-trump-supporter" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The Trump supporter</h2>
<p>I was out canvassing with a girl called Ali and we knocked on the door of a Trump supporter. We introduced ourselves and asked this woman of (I guess) 60 years how she was feeling about the upcoming election. “I support Donald Trump” she said, matter of factly, but not at all aggressively. This was a first. I was feeling all at sea in this situation but Ali was quick to inquire as to why this lady intended to vote for Trump.</p>
<p>The woman made a somewhat difficult to decipher point, the crux of which was that she was a business owner and therefore something something. Ali was again sharp and told the lady that her father was a small business owner and had difficulty affording his employees’ healthcare, particularly when times were tough for the business. This was gold, the lady immediately empathised with Ali’s father’s predicament. I had pulled myself together by this point and began to help Ali. I told the lady that in my view, it should not be down to a business to provide healthcare to its employees, because the employees will lose it when they lose their job and because it puts an unnecessary financial and administrative burden on businesses. She seemed particularly delighted that I mentioned the administrative burden; evidently she had had a lot of trouble sorting this out for her business. “So I guess you think the government should provide the healthcare?” she said. I knew I was getting into deep water with this Trump supporter now, but luckily the three of us had already built up a good rapport at this stage.</p>
<p>At this time her daughter (who appeared to be in her late 20s) was also listening in from upstairs, leaning her head over the banister at a most peculiar angle as she spoke and listened. She was in a dressing gown and evidently felt under-dressed to come down and speak to us at the door. Instead she held her head at this angle that the geometry of the house necessitated. I said that indeed the government should provide the healthcare. “Isn’t that socialism?” she said, with an approving angled nod from the daughter. I said that I believed that some government-led schemes were good, for example small business grants and <em>social</em> security. To my great surprise and relief, she was entirely satisfied with this answer, evidently having a very favourable view of social security.</p>
<p>At this point the mother and daughter began to open up to us some more. They told us that the lady’s husband was a veteran and that he really wasn’t getting the healthcare he needed from the Veteran’s Administration (VA). Ali sympathised very well and we both imparted that we thought this a disgrace. It was a good opportunity for us to call out the GOP for being too quick to send soldiers to war and yet reluctant to take good care of them when they return. Ali said that the <em>government</em> should ensure that the VA has all of the money it needs to take care of veterans.</p>
<p>The inevitable then happened. We were asked how we would pay for all of this healthcare. I said that healthcare would be paid for through taxation. I said that I would happily pay more taxes so that this veteran could have healthcare, even though I myself hadn’t needed the doctor in years. The lady was evidently taken aback by this, but the daughter was by now nodding vociferously, at the same angle. “You think this is how it should work? You think we should pay more taxes?” Ali assured her that we would be delighted to pay more taxes if it meant that more people got the healthcare that they needed. The lady found this truly fascinating, as did I. I dreaded having to mention the T word but on the other hand it is at the heart of what I believe in: higher taxes and better services for everyone. It was wonderful to see these beliefs gain legitimacy in this lady’s mind.</p>
<p>This was not a fairy tale. We did not manage to convince this woman to change her voter registration and vote for Bernie in the primary. We did, however, convince her that we cared about the problems that she faced with regard to her business and her husband, the veteran. We’ll never know to what extent we changed her mind about healthcare provision but I’m pretty sure that she believed that we—a couple of Bernie Sanders supporters—held these views out of good intentions.</p>
<p>It also strikes me that when she opened the door and introduced herself as a Trump supporter, in that moment, her mind was more open than mine. I had already painted an unflattering mental caricature of her. She, was just happy to see us.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-man-who-spoke-mandarin" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The man who spoke Mandarin</h2>
<p>We always had a list of houses that we were to visit. Most of the time you knocked and got no answer, which was fine. However, I noticed that it was always worth trying to talk to people who were in the street (walking their dog, doing their garden, etc). People would rarely flat out ignore you in this context.</p>
<p>One such time there was a man of Asian descent out tending his lawn. This seemed like a good call to me, given the condition of the lawn. I approached him and I could tell from a distance that he was immensely shy, so I started my Bernie spiel from a distance in the friendliest way I knew how, whilst slowly closing in on him (poor fellow). Quickly, it became apparent that he didn’t have the slightest clue what I was saying, but that he would prefer it if I went away. Using my profiling skills, I fished out a Mandarin Bernie leaflet and continued to approach him, hunched over so as to appear as nonthreatening as possible, all the while holding the leaflet outstretched. He gently took the leaflet and I retreated quickly so as to restore his comfort, saying “thank you, thank you.” His eyes lit up when he saw the leaflet; he clearly understood it and that was a pleasant surprise to him. I turned to walk away but he made a happy noise. I turned back around and he was holding the leaflet out towards me, pointing frantically at Bernie’s face. “Like this man! Like this man!” he said. We shared a very nice smile and I raised my fist into the air to emphasise my delight. That made my day.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-girl-with-the-nervous-dog" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The girl with the nervous dog</h2>
<p>One Saturday I was out canvassing for Bernie with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA was not officially affiliated with the Bernie campaign, they had just endorsed him and had the common goal of getting him elected. The DSA people were mostly very young and particularly disenfranchised with the political system. They hated the democrats for being an economically right-wing party. I am largely on board with this, my canonical example being Bill Clinton’s 1999 declaration that “the Glass–Steagall law is no longer appropriate.” No bona-fide left-wing party thinks like that. Allow me to list another couple of Democrat’s that supported Clinton’s repeal of that law: Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Anyway (forgive my temporary lapse into rant mode), I was paired with a girl (let’s call her Sally) who had driven all the way from Napa to Oakland to do this canvass (it’s a long way so good hustle). She was carrying a small dog in her arms that was visibly nervous; perhaps he didn’t like the smell of socialists.</p>
<p>One of the first houses we got to was home to a Warren supporter. It was a mother who was clearly being kept busy by her two toddlers. When she opened the door, her cat escaped. It was kind of getting away down the street and I asked the woman if I should go and get it; she said that I should. Sally was unconcerned, but by this time I had done enough canvassing to know that if we were complicit in the disappearance of the woman’s cat, that would be her abiding memory of the visit of these Bernie supporters. With great difficulty (I’m more of a dog person) I managed to shoo the cat back up the street towards the house. Meanwhile, Sally was tearing into this young mother: “Did you know that Warren voted to increase Trump’s war budget?” Sally had this kind of <em>gotcha</em> approach to canvassing whereby she tried to make people feel bad for voting for anyone but Bernie. This is a very tempting strategy, particularly when you don’t like the person at the door, but it is <em>never</em> effective. We had learned this in the canvassing training, but Sally couldn’t help herself. As we left, I told the woman that I liked Warren too. This did not impress her and Sally gave me a look of disdain. The woman did not display any gratitude for the return of her cat.</p>
<p>Down the street we came upon a barbecue outside a church, which was attended by dozens of black people. I approached rather gingerly (it looked like fun and I though the last thing they needed was some white guy coming in and telling them all how to vote). One of them noticed me and was extremely welcoming. When I said I didn’t want to spoil any fun, he told me he’d be there all day so it was no big thing to talk to us for 10 minutes. We told him all about Bernie and he was interested and engaged. He said he liked Bernie but that he was thinking of voting for Biden. We spoke for a while and built up a good rapport (I spoke to a hell of a lot of people during the campaign and noticed that black people seemed on average to be much more comfortable talking to strangers). In the end he took a Bernie leaflet and said excitedly that he’d put it on his fridge, but I still thought he would vote for Biden. As we went to leave, he went to pet the nervous dog. The little thing was growling and bearing its teeth, and the man persisted with getting slowly but fearlessly closer to a pat on the dog’s head. The inevitable happened. The dog bit him. His finger was bleeding. “Oh no, what a fucking scene,” I thought. The guy looked down at his finger and then kindly back towards the dog. “Is it cos of the color?”, he said to the dog, and then he laughed a really hearty laugh, evidently pleased with his joke. “Is your finger alright?”, I inquired. He showed me his finger and shot me a smile to let me know that my question was absurd. The man was not <em>at all</em> bothered. As we left, he was showing the leaflet to other people at the barbecue, evidently pleased with his interaction with us. You had to admire him. A minute later, Sally turned to me and said “I knew I should’ve given the dog some cannabis oil to calm him down before we left,” as if that were the most obvious thing in the world. I declined to comment in a way that made it known that this was not the most obvious thing in the world to me.</p>
</div>
<div id="another-sally-gotcha" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Another Sally gotcha</h2>
<p>Soon after, a door was opened by a black man of about 60. He said he was voting for Biden. “He was Obama’s vice president,” he said. It was kind of nice to see this man well up with pride and satisfaction at the thought of a black president. “But Biden voted to increase Trump’s war budget!” said Sally in a classic gotcha. I should’ve pointed out that Biden has not held office while Trump was president, but that didn’t occur to me at the time. “Well, he shouldn’t have done that. Bernie huh, I’ll vote for the guy,” said the gentleman in the doorway. He then politely ended the conversation and shut the door. There is no chance that that man did not vote for Biden.</p>
</div>
<div id="sometimes-youre-not-so-hot" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Sometimes you’re not so hot</h2>
<p>One of the doors I knocked on was opened by a young man of about 20. It was always good to see a young face (young people are much more likely to like Bernie). I gave him my spiel and he asked me an open-ended “what about Bloomberg” question, telling me that he’d seen a lot of ads for Mikey B (people were surprisingly open about their own susceptibility to TV ads). “Oh yes” I thought to myself, “fish in a barrel.” I had been canvassing for a while now and had gotten the hang of it. It’s difficult to explain what happened. I mumbled some incoherent stuff about Bloomberg having no idea what is wrong in the US and therefore being unable to fix it, mentioning the phrase “wealth tax” a few times. The key words are <em>mumble</em> and <em>incoherent</em>. The young man was perplexed and bored by the time I was finished. I gave him a leaflet. The saving grace was that even though I seemed like an idiot, I think I at least came across as a nice idiot. Nevertheless, I walked away disgusted at a missed opportunity. Not many people were opening their doors that day, so that annoyed me for a while.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-lady-from-the-philippines" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> The lady from the Philippines</h2>
<p>Walking around a neighborhood, I came upon a group of six Mexicans having their dinner on their front lawn. Of course, I bothered them. “No, we are Mexicans” was the response. “Are you US citizens?” I inquired. “Yes, we can vote, but one Mexican won’t make any difference,” said the man who had by now emerged as the group’s spokesman. “Six Mexicans might,” I said, clutching at straws. “Pfff” was the reaction to that assertion. These people were generally sympathetic to the Bernie message, but didn’t feel that their votes mattered. Again, it was almost impossible to turn non-voters into voters. I left these nice Mexicans in peace.</p>
<p>Soon after, a lady from the Philippines opened the door. She was a staunch Bernie supporter and we spoke for a while. She told us (among many other things) that her husband was Mexican. She said he was newly engaged in politics, but also now a strong Bernie supporter. I told her the story of the Mexican group down the block. I don’t think they really listen to someone like me (not that they should),&quot; I told her. “Yes you’re right,” she said, “they will never listen to <em>you</em>.” “They might listen to your husband,” I said, in a clearly leading way. “Yes, yes, I will send him around to talk to them,” she said gleefully. I was delighted with this. When you could recruit a volunteer like this, you knew you were picking up several votes at once. As I left, I went to shake her hand (which I did habitually in pre-COVID times). “Oh no sorry I can’t do that, but I can do this,” she said, prepping her hand for a gentle fist-pump. I guess it was for religious reasons that she couldn’t shake my hand, but I’ll never know. I felt bad for putting her in this uncomfortable position, but she let on that she didn’t mind at all. We exchanged the most delightful fist-pump and I was on my way. What a pleasure it was to talk to her.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-warren-supporter-walking-the-dog" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> The Warren supporter walking the dog</h2>
<p>Another person on the street walking the dog; I always stopped them. This woman was interesting: quite friendly and very open about her thoughts. She was staunchly progressive and evidently keen on Warren. We talked about policy for a while and eventually it was clear that policy-wise, either Bernie or Warren would have done her. “So why Warren?” I asked, “she’s a good candidate in my view, but she’s toast. Look at how she fared in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.” “You know”, she said, “you’re making sense. The thing is, I’m in my seventies, I probably have less than 20 years left and I just want to see a woman president before I die.” I didn’t really know what to say to that, so I said that I hoped very much that she would live to see that and that it would happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>I continued on my round and soon enough we intersected with her and her dog again. “I never said thank you,” she said. “I want to thank you for being out her and doing this, it’s really great that you’re out here. I hope it goes well and keep up the good work.” Her eager gratitude was heartwarming, particularly coming from the supporter of another candidate.</p>
<p>My interaction with this woman was representative of my experience canvassing. Canvassing is not an adversarial experience. The vast majority of people seem quite pleased to talk to a friendly stranger. Small or even large political differences didn’t change that (in my experience).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-black-mother-and-daughter-and-mlk" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> The Black mother and daughter and MLK</h2>
<p>I was out canvassing with DSA again with Andrew, a local union organiser. He was much better than me at the whole thing, being more used to working on all sorts of campaigns. We came to a house where a black mother and daughter were getting out of their car after a grocery run. We introduced ourselves as working for Bernie with DSA. The daughter was eager to get inside to avoid being bothered by us; the mother was more curious. The daughter told us that she thought us to be doing a disservice to the black community to self-identify as <em>socialists</em> because that word was used to smear MLK. I was all at sea here. I was not about to contend that we were a force for good on racial issues. Andrew (unlike myself) was a real MLK scholar and managed to engage this girl in a polite conversation about him. He didn’t manage to talk her around on the point of the use of the word <em>socialist</em> but he managed to display his admiration for MLK clearly enough to get us out of that particular bind. Meanwhile, the mother told us that the biggest issue for her was the deficit. That was the only time I heard that issue raised and neither Andrew nor I really fielded that one particularly well. By the end, she seemed to like us for the fact that she believed we were genuine in wanting everyone to have healthcare for everyone, but she wasn’t convinced to vote for Bernie.</p>
</div>
<div id="betty-the-japanese-woman" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Betty the Japanese woman</h2>
<p>I did group phone banking at a Japanese-American woman’s house in Berkeley every Tuesday. Betty was her name and she was around 4ft 10in and a grandmother to a child that would wander in and out (her daughter lived next door). She would serve very nice tea and every time she would have a new array of equally delicious Japanese desserts to go with it. Most of the other phone bankers were at least twice my age, so I could be useful there technology-wise (phone banking required a laptop and a phone and there was a knack to syncing them up to get going).</p>
<p>I looked forward to it every week. Betty would always give me a hug on my way out, which I cherished (it was particularly cute because she was so small). She was a staunch Bernie supporter. My laptop had a Warren sticker on it which Naomi (my wife) got when she signed us up to campaign for Liz. Betty gravely assured me that that wouldn’t do at all for a Bernie supporter and she promptly produced a bigger Bernie sticker and pasted it over the Warren sticker. Much better.</p>
<p>The others who attended the phone bank were also interesting. One was the girlfriend of Ted Rall, the author of the <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536904/bernie-by-ted-rall/">bestselling graphic novel about Bernie Sanders</a>. Ted had inspired her to volunteer for Bernie. It was Bernie’s <em>honesty</em> that impressed her the most. You heard this from a lot of people. They admired Bernie for having a <em>consistent</em> message for his decades-long career. One time she arrived with a signed copy of the book for Betty, who was absolutely delighted. It was very sweet.</p>
<p>Another was a retired New York journalist who had written articles for many famous and not so famous publications. She was pretty scathing of people who thought that Bernie was deep down a Soviet-style socialist and insisted that once one could get past that ridiculous thought, Bernie was clearly the best candidate. This was illustrative of older people’s view of Bernie. If he didn’t terrify you, you liked him.</p>
<p>There was a Berkeley student (early 20s) who came from time to time. He was nice and had a lot of enthusiasm but was a bit over-aggressive in his persuasion efforts. Every week he’d tell us a story of how he’d owned a Warren supporter online in the past few days. He was one of the few true <em>Bernie bro</em> people that I met on the campaign.</p>
