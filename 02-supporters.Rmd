# Bernie supporters


## Different demographics with different concerns

I met lots of wonderful Bernie supporters on the campaign. Most people had one particular issue that they cared about. I think it's interesting for a moment to dwell on who cared about what (of course I'll have to generalise and in reality these groups overlap). 

There were a lot of teachers and nurses, who cared about schools and healthcare. They also cared about their own wages, as they should; their wages under-value their work. These people were lifelong union members, many of them union organisers. Bernie often mentioned teachers and nurses in his stump speeches and teachers and nurses seemed to feel that Bernie really loved and valued them like no other candidate. Being teachers and nurses, the vast majority were women.

There were a hell of a lot of young people. They fear climate change and environmental destruction. I'll put myself into that category. They are also very worried about being able to afford a house; if I had aspirations of owning a home near the San Francisco Bay Area, I'd be worried about that too. As far as I could tell, all of the young people campaigning for Bernie were university educated. I was a bit disappointed by this. It would've been more interesting to have a mix and strategically, this didn't bode well for us. Curiously, many of these young people had never voted before (even though they had been of voting age in previous elections), mostly because they hadn't had a candidate that was far left enough to turn them out. I thought this did bode well for us; turning out new voters was key to the strategy.

There were a lot of old people (ages 60 and above). They were very angry about American foreign policy. Iraq was the last straw for them. The Obama administration's continued support for Saudi Arabia in their war with Yemen was last plus one. For most of them, their bitterness started with the Vietnam war. The no longer trusted what their government or mainstream media or government tell them about foreign policy. For them, Iraq was confirmation of what they already knew. They absolutely hated anyone who voted for that war, Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton being the most notable.

The black people that I met were most worried about police brutality against them and the disproportionate number of black people in prison. They hated Mike Bloomberg for _stop and frisk_. I was surprised that the black people I met never raised other issues of systemic racism, for example the pay gap. For them, the immediate threat was police violence and the prospect of prison; all else was secondary. Now that I think about it, of course that makes sense. I underestimated the level of suspicion that even well-to-do black people face in their daily lives.


## Bernie or bust?


These people hated the mainstream media. I remember one gentleman recalling that only the _Long Island Newsday_ had reported on the US invasion of Panama in 1989. Back then he was still very bitter about Viet Nam (He hadn't fought there but he was part of the anti-war protest movement at the time). This media blackout of the Panama invasion in '89 confirmed to him that the US media had not learned to hold the US government to account.
